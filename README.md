This paper presents the concept of Meaningless Game-Situations (MGS) in Major League Baseball (MLB), defined as situations in which a team has a 95% chance or greater of winning the game given the score at that particular inning in the game. We determine the run differentials for each inning that yield a 95% chance or greater of winning the game based on 2013-2016 MLB statistics and look at individual batter performances under MGS. We argue that including a split for MGS in major baseball statistical references should be considered.
